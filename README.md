# Client-Site-Digital-Agency
Digital Agency website for client: created through client's CMS provided by his CRM software.

Note: Was tasked with cleaning up previous developer's code site-wide while adding responsiveness. Asked to create and design 3 additional pages from scratch, as well as design a logo for the agency. I have uploaded the associated CSS and JS edits that I implemented.
